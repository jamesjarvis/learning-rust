CO663 Class - Learning Rust

## Outline

This is all based on the tutorials from [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)

## RUN LOCALLY

First, you're gonna need Rust installed.

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Or if you are on MacOS like I was, just run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
